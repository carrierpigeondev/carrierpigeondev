## Other stuff about me, I guess
I mainly use ***Windows 11*** for programming because I'm familiar with it, use ***Ubuntu 24.04*** in WSL on my desktop, and dual-boot Windows 11 and Pop!_OS on my old Alienware laptop (surpisingly good support).  

I use ***VSCode*** for all languages except for C#, ***Visual Studio 2022*** for C#. ***Neovim*** when not using Windows.
