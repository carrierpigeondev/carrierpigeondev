# Hello, Pigeons!  
I’m @carrierpigeondev

## Languages:
### 🐍 Python (Since December 2022)
### 🎵 C# + Unity (Since August 2023)
### 🥲 Rust (Since December 2023)
 
## Other stuff about me, I guess
I mainly use ***Windows 11*** for programming because I'm familiar with it, but I've experimented with Debian, Ubuntu, and Arch :)  
(The former two for CyberPatriot and the latter because why not)

I use ***VSCode*** for Python, ***Visual Studio 2022*** for C#, and ***Rust Rover*** for Rust. ***Neovim*** when not using Windows.
